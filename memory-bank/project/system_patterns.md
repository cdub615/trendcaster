# System Patterns: Expense Report Application

> **NOTE**: This is an example and should be updated for your application

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern web architecture with:

- React frontend for user interface
- AWS Amplify for backend services and authentication
- OpenAI for image recognition
- AWS S3 for receipt storage
- JSON data structure for expense data

## Key Design Patterns

- **Component-Based UI**: React components for modular interface
- **REST API**: For communication between frontend and backend
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user identification
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access and persistence
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management

## Data Flow

1. User uploads receipt image
2. Image is stored in S3
3. OpenAI processes image to extract data
4. Extracted data presented to user for verification
5. Verified data stored in database
6. Admin reviews and approves/rejects expenses
7. Reports generated from approved expenses

## Security Measures

- JWT for authentication
- HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Input validation for all user-submitted data
- Access control based on user roles
- Secure storage of receipt images and expense data
