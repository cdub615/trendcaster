# trendcaster

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Next, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Email & password authentication with Better Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database:

```bash
cd apps/server && pnpm db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Deep Research Assistant with Mastra

This project implements an advanced AI deep research assistant using Mastra's workflows and agent capabilities. It creates an interactive, human-in-the-loop research system that allows users to explore topics, evaluate results, and generate comprehensive reports.

## Implementation Approach

The research assistant is built on Mastra's workflows architecture for better orchestration and human interaction:

1. **Workflow-Based Architecture**:
   - `mainWorkflow`: Coordinates the entire research process
   - `researchWorkflow`: Handles the core research functionality with suspend/resume for user interaction
   - Human-in-the-loop experience with approval gates and iterative research

2. **Research Agent with Custom Tools**:
   - `webSearchTool`: Searches the web using the Exa API for relevant information
   - `evaluateResultTool`: Assesses result relevance to the research topic
   - `extractLearningsTool`: Identifies key learnings and generates follow-up questions

3. **Report Generation**:
   - `reportAgent`: Transforms research findings into comprehensive markdown reports
   - Returns report content directly after user approval of research quality

## Key Benefits of Mastra vNext Implementation

1. **True Human-in-the-Loop Research**: Users can guide the research process, approve findings, and iterate when needed

2. **Suspend/Resume Capabilities**: The workflow can pause at strategic points to collect user input and feedback

3. **Structured Workflow**: Clear separation between research, approval, and report generation phases

4. **Resilient Operation**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms when web searches fail

5. **Modular Design**: Each component (workflows, agents, tools) can be maintained and upgraded independently

## How to Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the research assistant
npm run dev
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

1. Enter your research topic
2. Review the research findings
3. Approve or reject the research results
4. If approved, a comprehensive report will be returned as output

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
EXA_API_KEY="your-exa-api-key"
```

## Required Dependencies

- `@mastra/core`: Core Mastra functionality with vNext workflows
- `@ai-sdk/openai`: OpenAI models integration
- `exa-js`: Exa API client for web search
- `zod`: Schema definition and validation for workflows
