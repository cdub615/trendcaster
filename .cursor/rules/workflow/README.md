# Workflow-Specific Rules

This directory contains rules tailored to different phases of the development workflow. These rules are activated based on the current `FOCUS` (Planning, Implementation, or Debugging) as determined by `core/00-meta-rules.md`.

- **`planning/`**: Contains `planning_rules.md` for when the `FOCUS` is on defining scope, features, and architecture.
- **`implementation/`**: Contains `implementation_rules.md` for when the `FOCUS` is on actively writing code based on an approved plan.
- **`debugging/`**: Contains `debugging_rules.md` for when the `FOCUS` is on identifying and fixing issues.

Consult the `README.md` within each subdirectory for more details on the specific workflow rules.
