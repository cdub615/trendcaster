# Core Rules

This directory contains fundamental rules for LLM interaction and project understanding. These rules are generally expected to be followed at all times.

- `00-meta-rules.md`: Meta-rules for LLM interaction, focus determination, and how other rules are applied.
- `general-coding-conventions.md`: Foundational software engineering principles for all code development in the project.
- `llm-interaction-guidelines.md`: Core principles guiding the LLM's interaction style, context gathering, and response formulation.
- `llm-memory-interaction.md`: Guidelines for how the LLM should use and process Memory Bank content, including specific instructions for architecture documents.
- `memory-bank-usage.md`: (To be created from `memory_bank_instructions.md`) General instructions for all users (developers and LLM) on how to utilize and maintain the Memory Bank.
