# Memory Bank Library Update Rule

**Purpose:** Manual rule for updating Memory Bank with library documentation roadmaps.

## Required Actions (Execute in Order)

### 1. Verify Library Name Consistency
- **Check Existing:** Scan `memory-bank/reference/api_docs/` for similar library names
- **Name Matching:** Recognize aliases (e.g., "amplify" = "aws-amplify", "react" = "reactjs")
- **Conflict Resolution:** If similar names exist, ask user: "Found existing [EXISTING_NAME]. Update that library or create separate entry for [NEW_NAME]?"
- **Standardize:** Use consistent naming across all memory bank entries

### 2. Crawl Documentation
- **Target:** User-specified documentation page for [LIBRARY_NAME]
- **Method:** Extract all navigation links, sections, sub-sections
- **Scope:** Comprehensive coverage of available documentation

### 3. Create Index Roadmap
- **Format:** Index-style, link-rich navigation file (NOT prose summary)
- **Content:** All major sections + direct links (internal & external)
- **Structure:** Hierarchical list matching documentation organization

### 4. Save Roadmap
- **Location:** `memory-bank/reference/api_docs/[LIBRARY_NAME]/[MAJOR_VERSION]/llms.md`
- **Filename:** Always `llms.md` 
- **Overwrite:** Replace existing roadmap if present

### 5. Notify Completion
- **Message:** "Documentation roadmap for [LIBRARY_NAME] v[MAJOR_VERSION] created at [path]. This will be used for all future package references."

## Critical Rules

**DO NOT:**
- Summarize or paraphrase content (unless explicitly requested)
- Skip paginated sections or sub-links
- Create prose overviews instead of navigation indexes
- Create duplicate entries for the same library under different names

**DO:**
- Include ALL top-level and significant sub-sections
- Maintain original link structure and hierarchy
- Follow [memory-bank-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/core/memory-bank-usage.mdc) for technical summaries if requested
- Check for existing library entries before creating new ones
- Use consistent naming conventions across all memory bank entries

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- **Cannot crawl page:** STOP and NOTIFY user immediately
- **Incomplete crawl:** Note missing sections, ask for guidance
- **Name ambiguity:** Ask user to clarify which library entry to update
