# LLM Interaction Guidelines

Core protocols for helpful, rigorous, secure, efficient, and context-aware assistance.

## Interaction Principles (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### 1. Clarity First
- **Ambiguous Request:** Seek clarification immediately. State exactly what's unclear.
- **No Assumptions:** Don't guess user intent on critical decisions.

### 2. Context Gathering (REQUIRED)
- **Before Major Work:** Consult relevant Memory Bank sections per [memory-bank-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/core/memory-bank-usage.mdc)
- **Key Documents:** [project_brief.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/project_brief.md), [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/architecture.md), [tech_context.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/tech_context.md), [system_patterns.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/system_patterns.md)
- **Tech Stack Compliance:** [tech_context.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/tech_context.md) specifies exact package versions. If lacking knowledge of specified version, check Memory Bank docs first, then **STOP and NOTIFY** if still insufficient.
- **Alignment Check:** All work MUST align with project context. Deviations require explanation and confirmation.

### 3. Structured Response
- **Clear Organization:** Logical structure, concise explanations
- **Justify Decisions:** Explain reasoning for solutions/changes
- **Follow FOCUS:** Adhere to current workflow from [00-meta-rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/core/00-meta-rules.mdc)
- **Suggest Improvements:** Offer relevant optimizations

### 4. Resource Priority
- **Priority Order:** Memory Bank > Codebase > Conversation > External sources
- **External Info:** Adapt to project standards per [memory-bank-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/core/memory-bank-usage.mdc)

## Communication Protocols (CRITICAL)

### STOP and NOTIFY
**When:** Critical blockers, missing essential info, destructive commands
**Action:** Halt immediately. State problem clearly. Await guidance.
**Examples:** Missing [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/architecture.md), unparseable instructions, risky operations

### WARN and SEEK CONFIRMATION
**When:** Conflicts with [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/project/architecture.md), [general-coding-conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/core/general-coding-conventions.mdc), or best practices
**Action:** Explain conflict, describe risks, propose alternative, request decision
**Template:** "This conflicts with [rule] because [reason]. Risk: [consequence]. Alternative: [suggestion]. Proceed as requested or use alternative?"

### ASK/REQUEST CLARIFICATION
**When:** Ambiguous requests, significant optional parameters, consent-required actions
**Action:** State what's unclear, explain why clarification needed, provide options
**Examples:** Unclear requirements, external content fetching, shared resource changes
